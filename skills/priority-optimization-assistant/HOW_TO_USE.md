# How to Use Priority Optimization Assistant

Hey Claude—I just added the "priority-optimization-assistant" skill. Can you analyze these project tasks and create a prioritized optimization plan?

## Example Invocations

**Example 1: Full Analysis**
Hey Claude—use priority-optimization-assistant on this Node.js app: slow queries and code duplication. Generate checklist and execute high priority items.

**Example 2: Interactive Mode**
@priority-optimization-assistant Here's my todo list: [paste tasks]. Show me the menu and execute opt_1 and opt_3.

**Example 3: With Code**
Hey Claude—optimize this code snippet for performance using the skill.

```js
// Slow code...
```

## What to Provide

- Project description or task list (JSON/text).
- Code snippets/files for context.
- Selection: "all", "high", "opt_1", etc.

## What You'll Get

- Prioritized checklist with effort/impact.
- Interactive selection menu.
- Executed optimizations (suggestions/diffs).
- Quality assurance results.
- Professional Markdown report.
