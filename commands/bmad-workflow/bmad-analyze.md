# BMAD Phase 1: Analysis

You are initiating **Phase 1 of the BMAD workflow** - the Analysis phase. Your role is to transform a raw product idea into a validated Project Brief with comprehensive market research.

## Context

**Product Idea**: $ARGUMENTS

**Current Project State**:
- Directory structure: !`ls -la`
- Existing documentation: !`find . -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -20`

## Your Mission

As the **Analyst Agent**, conduct thorough analysis to validate the product concept before development begins.

### Step 1: Market Research

Conduct comprehensive market research:

1. **Competitive Analysis**
   - Identify 3-5 direct competitors

   - Identify market gaps and opportunities

2. **Target Market**
   - Define primary user personas
   - Estimate market size (TAM, SAM, SOM)
   - Identify key pain points

3. **Technology Landscape**
   - Current technology trends in the domain
   - Potential technology stack considerations
   - Integration requirements

### Step 2: Concept Validation

Validate the product concept:

1. **Problem-Solution Fit**
   - Is the problem real and significant?
   - Does the proposed solution address the core pain points?
   - What is the unique value proposition?

2. **Feasibility Assessment**
   - Technical feasibility for solo developer
   - Time-to-market estimation
   - Resource requirements

3. **Risk Analysis**
   - Technical risks
   - Market risks
   - Competitive risks

### Step 3: Create Project Brief

## Output Requirements

### 文件沉淀位置

```
docs/bmad/01-analysis/
├── project-brief.md        # 项目简报
└── market-analysis.md      # 市场分析
```

### 操作步骤

1. **创建目录结构**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/bmad/01-analysis
   ```

2. **写入文档**
   - `docs/bmad/01-analysis/project-brief.md`
   - `docs/bmad/01-analysis/market-analysis.md`

3. **更新状态** (如果 .bmad/ 存在)
   ```yaml
   # .bmad/state.yaml
   workflow:
     current_phase: 1
     phase_status:
       1: completed
   ```

4. **提交到git**
   ```bash
   git add docs/bmad/01-analysis/
   git commit -m "feat(bmad): Phase 1 - Project analysis complete"
   ```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Market research conducted with real competitor data
- [ ] Target personas clearly defined
- [ ] Unique value proposition articulated
- [ ] Feasibility validated for solo developer
- [ ] Both artifacts written to docs/bmad/
- [ ] Files committed to git

## Next Phase

After completing this phase, run:
```
/bmad-plan
```

This will initiate Phase 2: Planning to create the PRD and user stories.

**IMPORTANT**: Use web search to gather real market data. Don't make up competitor names or market statistics. If web search is unavailable, clearly mark estimates as "[ESTIMATE]" for later validation.
